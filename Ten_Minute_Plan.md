## Ten Minute Plan
**due at 12 noon on 2015-11-09** via Github
	
## Instructions

1. Read this blog post on collaboration and writing a Ten Minute Plan written by Physicist 
and Scientific Software Developer, Bill Mills: 
http://billmills.github.io/blog/ten-minute-plans/

2. Set up a repository for your final project (you might have already done this) and 
migrate the code you are developing for your final project into this repository. This 
repository should:
	* have a well organized directory structure
	* your code in a relevant directory
	* your final project proposal in a relevant directory
	* a LICENCE.md in the project's root directory
	* a README.md with the title, your name and the date in the project's root directory

3. Write a 10 Minute Plan for the code you are developing for you final project. The ten 
minute plan should end up the README.md file. 

*Please please please make sure you give
the README file an .md extension, otherwise it wont be rendered and wont word wrap on 
Github and your peers will have a very difficult time reading it.*

4. To hand this in, add me as a collaborator to the repository (I will automatically get 
an email from Github that you have done this).

## Grading

This will be marked for completion. You will get out of this assignment what you put into 
it. The goal of the Ten Minute Plan is to facilitate the feedback your peers will be able 
to give you during group code review. Write a great ten minute plan, odds are you will be 
able to get great feedback during code review. On the other hand, write a poor Ten Minute
 Plan, expect poor feedback because no one will understand what you are trying to do.
